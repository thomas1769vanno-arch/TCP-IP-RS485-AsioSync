description: Close feature and deploy (junior workflow)
model: sonnet
---

## Prerequisites
- Read `j-settings.md` from project root (REQUIRED - run `j-setup` if missing)
- If not read this session: Read `.claude/commands/mind-sets/junior.md`
- Read (if not already done) MB skip all subdirs

## Steps

### 1. Verify Completion (use intelligence!)
Read MB, task folder (notes.md, plan.md, bug-notes.md), and recent commits.

**Check if work is actually complete:**
- Are all planned items done?
- Were tests run? (check notes or recent output)
- Does the code look finished?

**If something seems incomplete or unclear:**
```
Before closing, I want to make sure everything is ready.

I noticed that: [what doesn't add up - e.g.: "the plan has 3 items but only 2 are marked done"]

Do you want to close anyway or complete the remaining items first?
```

**If everything looks good → proceed.**

NOTE: Don't rely only on `@state` in MB - it could be wrong. Use your intelligence to assess the actual situation.

### 2. Review Changes Summary
Show user what will be closed and deployed:
```bash
git log {@main-branch}..HEAD --oneline
git diff {@main-branch}..HEAD --stat
```

```
Changes summary for this branch:

Commits: [number] commit(s)
Files changed: [list from diff --stat]

All of this will be merged into {@main-branch} and deployed.
```

This gives the junior a clear picture before proceeding.

### 3. Final Tests
- If backend modified: run `{@test-backend}` (from j-settings.md)
- If frontend modified: test with ChromeDevTools locally
- **Update notes.md:** mark "Tested" checkbox
- If tests fail → FIX before proceeding

### 4. Final Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(feature-name): complete description"
```

### 5. Push Feature Branch
**IMPORTANT:** Always push the feature branch BEFORE merging so user can review it on remote.
```bash
git push -u origin feature/NN-feature-name
```

### 6. Merge or Create PR

**Read `@merge-strategy` from j-settings.md:**

#### If `@merge-strategy: direct` — Merge locally
```bash
git checkout {@main-branch}
git pull origin {@main-branch}
git merge feature/NN-feature-name
```

**If merge shows CONFLICT:**
```
There are merge conflicts. This requires a senior developer.

WHAT TO DO:
1. DO NOT touch anything
2. Call a senior or write in the #help channel
3. Tell them: "I have merge conflicts in [branch]"

The senior will resolve it and tell you when to continue.
```
STOP - do not proceed until senior resolves.

### 7. Push Main
```bash
git push origin {@main-branch}
```

→ Continue to step 8 (Deploy).

#### If `@merge-strategy: pr` — Create Pull Request
```bash
gh pr create --base {@main-branch} --head feature/NN-feature-name \
  --title "feat(feature-name): description" \
  --body "## Changes\n- [list from notes.md]\n\n## Testing\n- [test results]"
```

If `gh` CLI is not available, show the URL:
```
Pull Request ready to create:

https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{@main-branch}...feature/NN-feature-name

Title: feat(feature-name): description
```

```
PR created! Link: [PR URL]

A reviewer will merge it. After merge:
- Deploy will happen via CI/CD (if configured)
- Or run j-deploy manually after merge

Branch: feature/NN-feature-name (kept for review)
```

→ Skip steps 7 and 8. Go directly to step 9.

#### If `@merge-strategy: gitflow` — PR to develop
Features always target `@dev-branch` (develop), never main directly.
```bash
gh pr create --base {@dev-branch} --head feature/NN-feature-name \
  --title "feat(feature-name): description" \
  --body "## Changes\n- [list from notes.md]\n\n## Testing\n- [test results]"
```

If `gh` CLI is not available, show the URL:
```
Pull Request ready to create:

https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{@dev-branch}...feature/NN-feature-name
```

```
PR created to {@dev-branch}! Link: [PR URL]

A reviewer will merge it into develop.
Release to main will happen through a release branch (managed by team lead).

Branch: feature/NN-feature-name (kept for review)
```

→ Skip steps 7 and 8. Go directly to step 9.

#### If `@merge-strategy: gitflow-simple` — Direct merge to develop
Features merge directly to `@dev-branch` (develop).
```bash
git checkout {@dev-branch}
git pull origin {@dev-branch}
git merge feature/NN-feature-name
```

**If merge shows CONFLICT:**
```
There are merge conflicts. This requires a senior developer.

WHAT TO DO:
1. DO NOT touch anything
2. Call a senior or write in the #help channel
3. Tell them: "I have merge conflicts in [branch]"

The senior will resolve it and tell you when to continue.
```
STOP - do not proceed until senior resolves.

```bash
git push origin {@dev-branch}
```

```
Feature merged into {@dev-branch}!

Deploy to production happens when develop is merged to main (managed by team lead).

Branch: feature/NN-feature-name (kept for review)
```

→ Skip step 8 (deploy). Go directly to step 9.

### 8. Deploy (if not already done, only for @merge-strategy: direct)

#### 8a. Check if Already Deployed
Check if user already deployed manually with j-deploy:
- Check notes.md for "Deployed" checkbox already marked
- Or ask user: "Have you already deployed with j-deploy?"

**If already deployed → skip to step 9**

If not deployed yet → continue:

**Update MB:** `@state::DEPLOY`

#### 8b. Read Deploy Documentation
Read `{@deploy-docs}` if exists (from j-settings.md)

#### 8c. Backup (Pre-Deploy)
Check `@backup-script` in j-settings.md.

**If @backup-script is NOT "none":**
```
Running backup before deploy...
```
```bash
{@backup-script}
```
- Show output to user
- If backup FAILS → STOP, do not deploy
```
Backup failed. Deploy cancelled.
Error: [show error]

Fix the backup issue before retrying.
```
Keep `@state::DEPLOY`.

**If @backup-script is "none":**
```
No backup script configured. Proceeding with deploy.
   (To configure: j-setup → edit @backup-script)
```

#### 8d. Execute Deploy
```bash
{@deploy-script}
```

#### 8e. Verify / Handle Failure
- If deploy succeeds → **Update notes.md:** mark "Deployed" checkbox → go to step 9

**If deploy FAILS:**

Check if `@restore-script` exists and is not "none":

**WITH restore available:**
```
Deploy failed. Error: [show error]

You have a backup ready. What do you want to do?

1. RESTORE
   → Run @restore-script to roll back to before the deploy

2. LET'S DEBUG
   → Debug the error together
```

**WITHOUT restore (no script configured):**
```
Deploy failed. Error: [show error]

What do you want to do?

1. ASK FOR HELP
   → Contact a senior, show them the error above

2. LET'S DEBUG
   → Debug the error together
```

**If user chooses RESTORE (option 1 with restore):**
```bash
{@restore-script}
```
- If restore succeeds:
```
Restore completed. Environment rolled back.
Use j-deploy to retry after fixing the issue.
```
- If restore fails:
```
Restore also failed. Error: [show error]

Contact a senior immediately.
Show them BOTH errors (deploy + restore).
```
STOP - keep `@state::DEPLOY`.

**If user chooses DEBUG (option 2):**
Continue debugging with user. Apply Protocol D if needed.
Keep `@state::DEPLOY` until resolved.

### 9. Update MB → IDLE (NO branch deletion)
**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT delete branches! User needs to see all branches on remote for control.
- Update MB:
  - In `progress.md` → add feature as completed
  - In `activeContext.md` → clear feature info, set state to IDLE

### 10. Confirm

**If `@merge-strategy: direct`:**
```
Feature [name] completed and deployed!

Verify at: {@domain} (from j-settings.md)

Next time you want to work, use j-new-feature
```

**If `@merge-strategy: pr`:**
```
Feature [name] — PR created!

PR: [link]
Branch: feature/NN-feature-name (kept for review)

After the PR is merged and deployed, use j-new-feature for the next task.
```

**If `@merge-strategy: gitflow` or `gitflow-simple`:**
```
Feature [name] — merged/PR'd to {@dev-branch}!

Deploy to production happens when develop is released to main (managed by team lead).

Next time you want to work, use j-new-feature
```

## Rules
- NEVER merge if tests fail
- NEVER deploy without testing
- NEVER delete branches (user needs them for review/control)
- ALWAYS push feature branch before merging
- Always update MB at the end
